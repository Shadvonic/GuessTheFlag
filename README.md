# GuessTheFlag

Covered:
 revisited Interface Builder, Auto Layout, outlets and other things, but at the same time you've learned about @2x and @3x images, asset catalogs, UIButton, CALayer, UIColor, random numbers, actions, UIAlertController
 
 Challenge
 1. Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
 2. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
 3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
